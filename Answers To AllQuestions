        # Run and Debug (Play icon): Manages debugging sessions.
        # Extensions (Square icon): Manages extensions and adds new functionalities to VS Code.
   2. Side Bar.
       The Side Bar contains context-specific tools and information related to the currently selected activity in the Activity Bar. For example.
        # When the Explorer is selected, the Side Bar shows the file and folder structure of your workspace.
        # When Search is selected, the Side Bar shows search results and replace options.
        # When Source Control is selected, the Side Bar shows changes, branches, and repositories.
        # When Extensions is selected, the Side Bar shows installed extensions and recommendations.
   3. Editor Group.
       . The Editor Group is where you edit your files. You can open multiple files in tabs, and VS Code supports multiple editor groups for side-by-side editing.

       . The Status Bar provides information and shortcuts related to the current workspace and active file.
       . Displays various pieces of information, such as:
         # Current file encoding: Shows the encoding of the active file.
         # Live Server status: If you are running a live server extension, it shows the server status and port number.
         # Current Git branch: If you are using Git, it shows the current branch name and provides Git status information.
